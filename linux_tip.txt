Upgrade Major Version of RedHat distros (ex: 5, 6, 7,...): so cumbersome, we have to backup the current data and then install/upgrade OS from scratch, finally store the data as before
Upgrade Minor Version (ex: 7.3, 7.4,...): use yum update
Difference between yum update and yum upgrade:
  - yum upgrade: delete the old packages version and replace them with the newest (if any)
  - yum update: preserve the old packages version, no install the new version, use update command if you consider some apps might conflit to each other because of newer version
